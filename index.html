            <h1>The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl</h1>
            <p>This traditional Chinese story is directly linked to the Qixi Festival (七夕节), a romantic holiday (similar in spirit to Valentine's day) which falls on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Lunar calendar.</p>
            <p><strong>One variation of the story goes...</strong></p>
            <p>A young man named Niulang (牛郎, literally meaning cowherd) once saved a sickly ox (who was once the God of Cattle). To return such kindness, the ox introduced Niulang to Zhinu (织女, literally meaning weaver girl) a fairy of the Heavens who descended to Earth to escape her wearisome life. Zhinu and Niulang eventually fell in love and agreed to get married. <br><br>Together they lived happily in the mortal realm and even had two children. However, word got out to the Goddess of Heaven (or her mother in some retellings) that the young fairy was married in the moral realm and Zhinu was forced to return to the Heavens. <br><br>Seeing that Niulang could not follow his wife back to the Heavens he became very depressed. Niulang's loyal ox one day said to him that if he were to kill him and wear his hide, he would be able to ascend to the Heavens and reunite with Zhinu. <br><br>Touched by the ox's loyalty and sacrifice, Niulang wore his hide and took their children in search of their mother. The Goddess of Heaven was again furious at this knowledge and used her hairpin to tear a river in the sky to forever keep Zhinu and Niulang apart. <br><br>This river thus formed the Milky Way dividing the stars Altair (Niulang) and Vega (Zhinu).<br>Saddened by the distance between the lovers, all the world's magpies once a year would flock to the Heavens and form a bridge (鹊桥) so that the two could meet and be together for one night out of the year. This night being the seventh day of the seventh month of the Lunar Calendar.</p>

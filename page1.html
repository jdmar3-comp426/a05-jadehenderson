            <p>Qixi has been celebrated for over 2,000 years, dating back to the Han Dynasty.</p>
            <p>The next Qixi will be August 4th, 2022.</p>
            <p>Seeing that Qixi is one of China's oldest festivals, it has been added to the list of National Intangible Cultural Heritage by the State Council in China.</p>
            <h2>Traditions</h2>
            <p>Qixi is widely celebrated as a romantic day in which gifts are often given.</p>
            <p>Another tradition is that women will often pray to Zhinu for the gift of sewing seeing that she was the fairy of weaving. During Qixi some women will
                compete in sewing while also offering fruit to Zhinu in order to be blessed with the ability to weave.</p>
                <p>Children also take part in this festival by picking flowers and offering it Niulang's loyal ox in honor of his sacrifice.</p>
